# ENPM673 Perception for Autonomous Robots
## Project-4 

## Overview


## Dependencies
* Python3
* OpenCV
* matplotlib
* Numpy

## Install Dependencies
* Google Collaboratory
* Install Python3, and the necessary libraries: (if not already installed)
````
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-opencv
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
pip install numpy
````

### Run for Problem-1
* Unzip the folder into your system
````
Copy the following required dataset folders/files into the above directory:
-- Cars On Highway
````
* Open terminal 
* Double check if all dependencies are installed
* Run the following command in terminal 
````

### Run for Problem-2
* Upload the following Problem-2.ipynb file to the google collab.
* Mount your google drive and upload the unziped dataset folder.
* Change the directory in the code, if necessary.
* Change the runtime to GPU using runtime>change_runtime_type> Select GPU
